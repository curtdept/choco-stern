# choco-stern

This repository is the source for the packaging around [Stern](https://github.com/curtdept/choco-stern).

The source and releases for Stern are located on their [github page](https://github.com/wercker/stern).

If there are any issues please file them here. 
I will try to attend to them ASAP.

If a new version is needed, right now it's a manual update for me to support.
I will eventually be looking at automatic packaging in the near future.
